# CSGO-Intermediate-Guide
A guide that picks up where the [newbie guide](https://github.com/swiprCS/CSGO-Newbie-Guide) leaves off.

**Basic Mechanics**

* [TheWarOwl - How does recoil work in CS:GO](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=octRQYnnuig)

* [TheWarOwl - How to Practice Recoil Control](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GvA5LO-CtOY)

* [TheWarOwl - CS:GO Economy Guide](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DpXtRbggpQM) (The only thing that doesn't apply anymore from this video, is the loss round bonus money. Here is the updated version of the loss bonus -->) [TheWarOwl - Meta Change w/Loss Round Bonus](https://youtu.be/AJwiFID3IdU?t=54)

**Movement** (While we can go over what Surfing, Bhopping, and KZ is able to do for your mechanics, not many guides will bring up the importance of what else is involved, such as of information shown in [this image](http://clutchround.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/csgo_corners_and_angles_dust2_T_CT.png), and [this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a8YRkgwE_rk). It would be great to try and cover the different facets in hopes that people become aware of such factors sooner)

* Make sure to be aware that there's more to movement than the typical "kz, bhop, and surfing", since peeking even has its own methods (wide/shoulder/jiggle peeks) that involve counterstrafing, which is essential to understand when elevating your game. Remember it takes a lot of time to grasp and master, so have patience and it'll pay off in the end!

**Helpful Resources**

* YouTube - [adreN](https://www.youtube.com/user/CurseCS/videos), [TheWarOwl](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SRLVloYyf9k&list=PLHF999pjo89Nu55Ep1Y0UHHLKluF5c-IK), [steel](https://www.youtube.com/user/JoshNissanCS/videos), [voo CSGO](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC2vjGuOTH-KcRCLSm5F3oUA), [3kliksphilip](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLfwtcDG7LpxGeQUBNIQHTNsSBrjzi2jX0) (He also has very informational videos regarding other aspects of the game), [BananaGaming](https://www.youtube.com/user/OfficialBananaGamers) (Makes update videos a lot too, helps with knowing what changes are made in the game), [n0thing](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G3jAOcjIBfk&list=PL60ZobTZpb7KSTs99Y9XZKbL5UM3CkD3R) (While some of his content may pertain to the questions of more experienced CS players, he has an array of informational videos, and is very open with explaining his thought process behind actions within the game).

* LuckySkillFaker also has a great series called [Noob to Pro](https://m.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLfIyu2flKmBCTgQdmDH0fiZUaagB4rD0_), which can help you take the process step by step (which is pretty in-depth and provides routines to help build muscle memory and be able to retain your skills).

**Workshop Help**

There are also tons of useful workshop maps that you can subscribe to through the steam workshop, which can provide ways to warmup, learn maps, and practice new skills.

* [Aim_botz](https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=243702660) by Mr. uLLeticaLâ„¢-S-. This one is commonly used to warmup, as well as for practicing new skills with the options it provides you (moving bots, peek boxes, long range, uneven ground, etc.)

* [YPrac Maps](https://steamcommunity.com/workshop/filedetails/?id=740795413) by Yesber. These are the multi-purpose maps that allow you to learn the common angles people will hold on each map, as well as grenade lineups, a neat way to find your own, and other miscellaneous things.

**Other**

If you're having difficulties pinpointing bad habits you may have developed, or you'd like some feedback about your gameplay, the r/csgocritic subreddit may be useful. There, you can submit one of your matches to be analyzed by other community members. TheOnlyBarker has done analyses there many times, so feel free to send him a PM if you want a match to be looked at. If these do not provide much help, voo CS:GO has made a video on [how to analyze your own demos](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJUfagFvxL0).

* Sometimes you will learn best by sitting back and watching those that are more experienced than you, which can be done by watching professional matches/some selective streamers ([n0thing](https://www.twitch.tv/n0thing), [autimatic](https://www.twitch.tv/autimatictv)], [flusha](https://www.twitch.tv/flusha), etc, those who do not go exclusively for flashy plays). Although it may be complex to understand their decisionmaking, focusing on one thing at a time, and trying to incorporate it into your play may prove to be benficial. For example, a rudimentary skill is crosshair placement, which can be seen at nearly every second of play.

* Will continue this bullet point later, but basically what Steel goes over in [this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q3RGvu88tTw) (how just because a play worked, doesn't mean that it's always the right play, due to situational reasons)

* At the end of it all, make sure that you're still having fun, and focusing on things one step at a time. We can get ahead of ourselves, treating the game like our lives depend on it. Being carefree from time to time and enjoying fun workshop maps can allow your overall experience with the game to be better than you could've ever imagined. Have fun, and remember that the process is very long, but worth it if you treat it correctly.
